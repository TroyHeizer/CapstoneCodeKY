A console application capable of generating a movie with a nearby anniversary or mentions of dates in close proximity to the current date within the movie.
In other words, if today is October 3rd the console application would reccomend "Mean Girls" as it is mentioned in the film.

Other Examples:

Jul 16th = "Hocus Pocus" (relaese date)
Feburay 2nd = "Groundhog Day" (takes place on date)
Oct 31 = "Halloween" (takes place on date)
Dec 23rd = "Home Alone" (takes place on date)


The application is written in C# to handle the program logic.

SQL will handle the database and models.
